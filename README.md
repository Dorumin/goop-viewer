# TODO
- Implement active image highlight in the image band
- Steal FlyPhotos's bottom navigation band, it's much smoother to scroll through it and needs no scrollbar
- Proper settings
- Scaling options/switcher (original fit, fit to container, fit to smaller dimension, cover)
- Properly use the image cache for static and optimized bottom band
- Dev mode (specifically to toggle the red square off)
- Live updates for the folder and event stream from the native code
- ffmpeg sidecar live transcoding for unsupported formats and transparency webgl shader
- Thumbnails and metadata generated from native? Hard ffmpeg/ffprobe requirement
- Startup screen for no files selected, open file icon (ctrl+o)
- Zooming in could hide the image behind the bottom band and the topbar for aesthetics (background gloss?)
  - Backdrop filter with blur and brightness, filter settings could be useful on lots of elements
- Show scale percentage when zooming in like FlyPhotos does, but don't let it stop scroll events (lol)
- Test and continuously optimize for folders with up to 100k files (streaming and syncing client/server's gonna suck)
- Bottom band scale cover/contain setting, scaling (FP uses 70/cover, IG uses 60/contain, 100h80w with 5px spacing plus filename)
- Sometimes the app freezes in dev mode, so make sure it doesn't do that on release
- Image rendering smooth/pixelated setting, but pixelated is clearly superior
- ~~Checkered background for transparent images, toggleable, make it not scale with the image zoom~~
- ~~Clamp zoom values like ImageGlass and don't crash on overflowing f32 like FlyPhotos (lol) (make adaptive to image size, 1-5%?)~~
- Window effects toggling (Acrylic/transparent/opaque... I guess that last one is just changing the bg color)
  - FlyPhotos has an *awesome* looking one, Frozen, that's implemented using a compositor of sorts. Would be great to steal!
- Keyboard navigation (tabbing sorta works, but something better, more intuitive)
  - Left/right for navigation, up/down not obvious; maybe panning, for crazy desktop manga readers
  - Configurable start zoom mode and position (center, start, end) for this purpose
- Theming (oh god) background colors, text, accents, toggle background blurred TikTok cringe preview that was Robyn's idea, etc.
- Make more resilient against files being updated in terms of cache/reload/event streaming/syncing
- Toggle filenames in the bottom bar for IG-vs-FP modes
- Rotate/flip images (but why? all the other apps do it, who even uses it?)
- Icons... basically all of them, or any of them
- Configure linters n' formatters
